        <p><h6 class="name lady">LADY WINDERMERE.</h6></p> <p class="stage-direction">[_Turning to her_.]</p><p class="speech">You opened a letter of mine to my
        husband?  You wouldn’t dare!</p>
        
        <p><h6 class="name erlynne">MRS. ERLYNNE.</h6></p><p class="speech">Dare!  Oh! to save you from the abyss into which you are
        falling, there is nothing in the world I would not dare, nothing in the
        whole world.  Here is the letter.  Your husband has never read it.  He
        never shall read it.</p> <p class="stage-direction">[_Going to fireplace_.]</p> <p class="speech">It should never have been
        written.</p>  <p class="stage-direction">[_Tears it and throws it into the fire_.]</p>
        
        <p><h6 class="name lady">LADY WINDERMERE.</h6></p> <p class="stage-direction"> [_With infinite contempt in her voice and look_.]</p><p class="speech">How
        do I know that that was my letter after all?  You seem to think the
        commonest device can take me in!</p>
        
        <p><h6 class="name erlynne">MRS. ERLYNNE.</h6></p>  <p class="speech">Oh! why do you disbelieve everything I tell you?  What
        object do you think I have in coming here, except to save you from utter
        ruin, to save you from the consequence of a hideous mistake?  That letter
        that is burnt now _was_ your letter.  I swear it to you!</p>
        
        <p><h6 class="name lady">LADY WINDERMERE.</h6></p>  <p class="stage-direction">[_Slowly_.]</p>  <p class="speech">You took good care to burn it before I had
        examined it.  I cannot trust you.  You, whose whole life is a lie, could
        you speak the truth about anything?</p>  <p class="stage-direction">[_Sits down_.]</p>
        
        <p><h6 class="name erlynne">MRS. ERLYNNE.</h6></p>  <p class="stage-direction">[_Hurriedly_.]</p>  <p class="speech">Think as you like about me—say what you
        choose against me, but go back, go back to the husband you love.</p>
        
        <p><h6 class="name lady">LADY WINDERMERE.</h6></p>  <p class="stage-direction">[_Sullenly_.]</p> <p class="speech">I do _not_ love him!</p>
        
        <p><h6 class="name erlynne">MRS. ERLYNNE.</h6></p>  <p class="speech">You do, and you know that he loves you.</p>
        
        <p><h6 class="name lady">LADY WINDERMERE.</h6></p>  <p class="speech">He does not understand what love is.  He understands it
        as little as you do—but I see what you want.  It would be a great
        advantage for you to get me back.  Dear Heaven! what a life I would have
        then!  Living at the mercy of a woman who has neither mercy nor pity in
        her, a woman whom it is an infamy to meet, a degradation to know, a vile
        woman, a woman who comes between husband and wife!</p>
        
        <p><h6 class="name erlynne">MRS. ERLYNNE.</h6></p>  <p class="stage-direction">[_With a gesture of despair_.]</p> <p class="speech">Lady Windermere, Lady
        Windermere, don’t say such terrible things.  You don’t know how terrible
        they are, how terrible and how unjust.  Listen, you must listen!  Only go
        back to your husband, and I promise you never to communicate with him
        again on any pretext—never to see him—never to have anything to do with
        his life or yours.  The money that he gave me, he gave me not through
        love, but through hatred, not in worship, but in contempt.  The hold I
        have over him—</p>
        
        <p><h6 class="name lady">LADY WINDERMERE.</h6></p>  <p class="stage-direction">[_Rising_.]</p>  <p class="speech">Ah! you admit you have a hold!</p>
        
        <p><h6 class="name erlynne">MRS. ERLYNNE.</h6></p>  <p class="speech">Yes, and I will tell you what it is.  It is his love for
        you, Lady Windermere.</p>
        
        <p><h6 class="name lady">LADY WINDERMERE.</h6></p>  <p class="speech">You expect me to believe that?</p>
        
        <p><h6 class="name lady">MRS. ERLYNNE.</h6></p>  <p class="speech">You must believe it!  It is true.  It is his love for you
        that has made him submit to—oh! call it what you like, tyranny, threats,
        anything you choose.  But it is his love for you.  His desire to spare
        you—shame, yes, shame and disgrace.</p>
