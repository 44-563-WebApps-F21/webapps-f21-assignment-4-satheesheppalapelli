    <pre>                  ACT III
<p><h6>LADY WINDERMERE.</h6></p><p>[_Standing by the fireplace_.]</p><p>Why doesn’t he come?
This waiting is horrible.  He should be here.  Why is he not here, to
wake by passionate words some fire within me?  As for Lord Darlington—Oh! here
he is!  What shall I do?  What can I say to him?  Will he let me go away
at all?  I have heard that men are brutal, horrible . . . Oh!</p>
<p>[_Hidesher face in her hands_.]</p>
<p>[_Enter_ MRS. ERLYNNE _L._]</p>
<p><h6>MRS. ERLYNNE.</p></h6></p><p>Lady Windermere!</p><p>[LADY WINDERMERE _starts and looks up_.
_Then recoils in contempt_.]</p><p>Thank Heaven I am in time.  You must go
back to your husband’s house immediately.</p>
<p><h6>LADY WINDERMERE.</h6></p><p>Must?</p>
<p><h6>MRS. ERLYNNE.</h6></p><p>[_Authoritatively_.]</p><p>Yes, you must!  There is not a
second to be lost.  Lord Darlington may return at any moment.</p>
<p><h6>LADY WINDERMERE.</h6></p><p>Don’t come near me!</p>
<p><h6>MRS. ERLYNNE.</h6></p><p>Oh!  You are on the brink of ruin, you are on the brink of
a hideous precipice.  You must leave this place at once, my carriage is
waiting at the corner of the street.  You must come with me and drive
straight home.</p>
<p>[LADY WINDERMERE _throws off her cloak and flings it on the sofa_.]</p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p><h6>LADY WINDERMERE.</h6></p> <p>Mrs. Erlynne—if you had not come here, I would have
gone back.  But now that I see you, I feel that nothing in the whole
world would induce me to live under the same roof as Lord Windermere.
You fill me with horror.  There is something about you that stirs the
wildest—rage within me.  And I know why you are here.  My husband sent
you to lure me back that I might serve as a blind to whatever relations
exist between you and him.</p>
<p><h6>MRS. ERLYNNE.</h6></p><p>Oh!  You don’t think that—you can’t.</p>
<p><h6>LADY WINDERMERE.</h6></p><p>Go back to my husband, Mrs. Erlynne.  He belongs to you
and not to me.  I suppose he is afraid of a scandal.  Men are such
cowards.  They outrage every law of the world, and are afraid of the
world’s tongue.  But he had better prepare himself.  He shall have a
scandal.  He shall have the worst scandal there has been in London for
years.  He shall see his name in every vile paper, mine on every hideous
placard.</p>
<p><h6>MRS. ERLYNNE.</h6></p><p>No—no—</p>
<p><h6>LADY WINDERMERE.</h6></p><p>Yes! he shall.  Had he come himself, I admit I would
have gone back to the life of degradation you and he had prepared for
me—I was going back—but to stay himself at home, and to send you as his
messenger—oh! it was infamous—infamous.</p>
<p><h6>MRS. ERLYNNE.</h6></p><p>[_C._]</p><p>Lady Windermere, you wrong me horribly—you wrong
your husband horribly.  He doesn’t know you are here—he thinks you are
safe in your own house.  He thinks you are asleep in your own room.  He
never read the mad letter you wrote to him!</p>
<p><h6>LADY WINDERMERE.</h6></p><p>[_R._]<p></p>Never read it!</p>
<p><h6>MRS. ERLYNNE.</h6></p><p>No—he knows nothing about it.</p>
<p><h6>LADY WINDERMERE.</h6></p><p>How simple you think me!</p><p>[_Going to her_.]</p> You are
lying to me!</p>
<p><h6>MRS. ERLYNNE.</h6></p><p>[_Restraining herself_.]</p><p>I am not.  I am telling you the
truth.</p>
<p><h6>LADY WINDERMERE.</h6></p><p>If my husband didn’t read my letter, how is it that you
are here?  Who told you I had left the house you were shameless enough to
enter?  Who told you where I had gone to?  My husband told you, and sent
you to decoy me back.</p><p>[_Crosses L._]</p>
<p><h6>MRS. ERLYNNE.</h6></p><p>[_R.C._]</p><p>Your husband has never seen the letter.  I—saw
it, I opened it.  I—read it.</p>
