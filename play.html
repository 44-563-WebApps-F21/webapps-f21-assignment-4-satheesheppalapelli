                                    ACT III
        LADY WINDERMERE.  [_Standing by the fireplace_.]  Why doesn’t he come?
        This waiting is horrible.  He should be here.  Why is he not here, to
        wake by passionate words some fire within me?  I am cold—cold as a
        loveless thing.  Arthur must have read my letter by this time.  If he
        cared for me, he would have come after me, would have taken me back by
        force.  But he doesn’t care.  He’s entrammelled by this woman—fascinated
        by her—dominated by her.  If a woman wants to hold a man, she has merely
        to appeal to what is worst in him.  We make gods of men and they leave
        us.  Others make brutes of them and they fawn and are faithful.  How
        hideous life is! . . . Oh! it was mad of me to come here, horribly mad.
        And yet, which is the worst, I wonder, to be at the mercy of a man who
        loves one, or the wife of a man who in one’s own house dishonours one?
        What woman knows?  What woman in the whole world?  But will he love me
        always, this man to whom I am giving my life?  What do I bring him?  Lips
        that have lost the note of joy, eyes that are blinded by tears, chill
        hands and icy heart.  I bring him nothing.  I must go back—no; I can’t go
        back, my letter has put me in their power—Arthur would not take me back!
        That fatal letter!  No!  Lord Darlington leaves England to-morrow.  I
        will go with him—I have no choice.  [_Sits down for a few moments_.
        _Then starts up and puts on her cloak_.]  No, no!  I will go back, let
        Arthur do with me what he pleases.  I can’t wait here.  It has been
        madness my coming.  I must go at once.  As for Lord Darlington—Oh! here
        he is!  What shall I do?  What can I say to him?  Will he let me go away
        at all?  I have heard that men are brutal, horrible . . . Oh!  [_Hides
        her face in her hands_.]
        
        [_Enter_ MRS. ERLYNNE _L._]
        
        MRS. ERLYNNE.  Lady Windermere!  [LADY WINDERMERE _starts and looks up_.
        _Then recoils in contempt_.]  Thank Heaven I am in time.  You must go
        back to your husband’s house immediately.
        
        LADY WINDERMERE.  Must?
        
        MRS. ERLYNNE.  [_Authoritatively_.]  Yes, you must!  There is not a
        second to be lost.  Lord Darlington may return at any moment.
        
        LADY WINDERMERE.  Don’t come near me!
        
        MRS. ERLYNNE.  Oh!  You are on the brink of ruin, you are on the brink of
        a hideous precipice.  You must leave this place at once, my carriage is
        waiting at the corner of the street.  You must come with me and drive
        straight home.
        
        [LADY WINDERMERE _throws off her cloak and flings it on the sofa_.]
        
        What are you doing?
        
        LADY WINDERMERE.  Mrs. Erlynne—if you had not come here, I would have
        gone back.  But now that I see you, I feel that nothing in the whole
        world would induce me to live under the same roof as Lord Windermere.
        You fill me with horror.  There is something about you that stirs the
        wildest—rage within me.  And I know why you are here.  My husband sent
        you to lure me back that I might serve as a blind to whatever relations
        exist between you and him.
        
        MRS. ERLYNNE.  Oh!  You don’t think that—you can’t.
        
        LADY WINDERMERE.  Go back to my husband, Mrs. Erlynne.  He belongs to you
        and not to me.  I suppose he is afraid of a scandal.  Men are such
        cowards.  They outrage every law of the world, and are afraid of the
        world’s tongue.  But he had better prepare himself.  He shall have a
        scandal.  He shall have the worst scandal there has been in London for
        years.  He shall see his name in every vile paper, mine on every hideous
        placard.
        
        MRS. ERLYNNE.  No—no—
        
        LADY WINDERMERE.  Yes! he shall.  Had he come himself, I admit I would
        have gone back to the life of degradation you and he had prepared for
        me—I was going back—but to stay himself at home, and to send you as his
        messenger—oh! it was infamous—infamous.
        
        MRS. ERLYNNE.  [_C._]  Lady Windermere, you wrong me horribly—you wrong
        your husband horribly.  He doesn’t know you are here—he thinks you are
        safe in your own house.  He thinks you are asleep in your own room.  He
        never read the mad letter you wrote to him!
        
        LADY WINDERMERE.  [_R._]  Never read it!
        
        MRS. ERLYNNE.  No—he knows nothing about it.
        
        LADY WINDERMERE.  How simple you think me!  [_Going to her_.]  You are
        lying to me!
        
        MRS. ERLYNNE.  [_Restraining herself_.]  I am not.  I am telling you the
        truth.
        
        LADY WINDERMERE.  If my husband didn’t read my letter, how is it that you
        are here?  Who told you I had left the house you were shameless enough to
        enter?  Who told you where I had gone to?  My husband told you, and sent
        you to decoy me back.  [_Crosses L._]
        
        MRS. ERLYNNE.  [_R.C._]  Your husband has never seen the letter.  I—saw
        it, I opened it.  I—read it.
